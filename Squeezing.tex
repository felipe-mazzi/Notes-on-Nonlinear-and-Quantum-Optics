\chapter{Squeezing}

In this chapter, I will draw from multiple sources, which will often display tremendous overlap. Some concepts and definitions will therefore appear more than once, with different levels of sophistication.

\section{Introduction and Basic Concepts}

Squeezed states of light have less noise in one selected quadrature than the value dictated by the Quantum Noise Limit (QNL). In other words, the variance in one of the quadratures is lower than shot-noise level.

Nonlinear optical processes can be used to generate squeezed states of light. What follows is an attempt to make this fact somewhat intuitive.
